                <h2>Serial Experiments Lain</h2>
                <p>A Lain Iwakura, an awkward and introverted fourteen-year-old, is one of the many girls from her
                    school to receive a disturbing email from her classmate Chisa Yomoda-the very same Chisa who
                    recently committed suicide. Lain has neither the desire nor the experience to handle even basic
                    technology; yet, when the technophobe opens the email, it leads her straight into the Wired, a
                    virtual world of communication networks similar to what we know as the internet. Lain's life is
                    turned upside down as she begins to encounter cryptic mysteries one after another. Strange men
                    called the Men in Black begin to appear wherever she goes, asking her questions and somehow knowing
                    more about her than even she herself knows. With the boundaries between reality and cyberspace
                    rapidly blurring, Lain is plunged into more surreal and bizarre events where identity,
                    consciousness, and perception are concepts that take on new meanings.

                    <p>Claude Monet also known as Oscar-Claude Monet or Claude Oscar Monet (November 14, 1840 – December
                        5, 1926) was a founder of French impressionist painting, and the most consistent and prolific
                        practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature,
                        especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting. The term Impressionism is derived from
                        the title of his painting Impression, Sunrise.</p>

                    <p>Vincent van Gogh, in full Vincent Willem van Gogh, (born March 30, 1853, Zundert,
                        Netherlands—died July 29, 1890, Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, France), Dutch painter, generally
                        considered the greatest after Rembrandt van Rijn, and one of the greatest of the
                        Post-Impressionists. The striking colour, emphatic brushwork, and contoured forms of his work
                        powerfully influenced the current of Expressionism in modern art. Van Gogh’s art became
                        astoundingly popular after his death, especially in the late 20th century, when his work sold
                        for record-breaking sums at auctions around the world and was featured in blockbuster touring
                        exhibitions. In part because of his extensive published letters, van Gogh has also been
                        mythologized in the popular imagination as the quintessential tortured artist..</p>

                    <h3><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Salvador-Dali">Salvador Dalí</a></h3>
                    <p>Salvador Dalí, in full Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí y Domenech, (born May 11, 1904, Figueras,
                        Spain—died January 23, 1989, Figueras), Spanish Surrealist painter and printmaker, influential
                        for his explorations of subconscious imagery.
                        Salvador Dalí and Man Ray
                        As an art student in Madrid and Barcelona, Dalí assimilated a vast number of artistic styles and
                        displayed unusual technical facility as a painter. It was not until the late 1920s, however,
                        that two events brought about the development of his mature artistic style: his discovery of
                        Sigmund Freud’s writings on the erotic significance of subconscious imagery and his affiliation
                        with the Paris Surrealists, a group of artists and writers who sought to establish the “greater
                        reality” of the human subconscious over reason. To bring up images from his subconscious mind,
                        Dalí began to induce hallucinatory states in himself by a process he described as “paranoiac
                        critical.”
